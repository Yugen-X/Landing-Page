# Landing-Page
Landing page project from The Odin Project curriculum.
I realize that I should have been saving and commiting after all the major changes in my code.
But the short answer is i was just to lazy to do so.
So if I ever come back to this project and fix it up or add more content to the page I will commit and push every change that i make.
